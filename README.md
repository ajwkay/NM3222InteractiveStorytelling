# NM3222 Interactive Storytelling
Project files for NM3222 Interactive Storytelling project assignments.

Project 1 - Moonlight Shadows: 
Aim of the assignment was to create an interactive fiction work centered around the concepts of agency and replayability. Agency in the form of giving the player a sense that their actions are affecting the outcomes of the story, and replayability by providing players value and reason to explore the story multiple times. This project was developed on Hypdyn2.

Project 2 - Fragments: 
This assignment was more focused on the concept of emotional agency. In contrast to the previous assignment where player choice affects the outcome of the story, emotional agency focuses more on providing different perspectives to the story to invoke different emotions from the player based on their choices; whether the outcome is affected as well is a irrevelant. This project was developed on Hypdyn2.

Project 3 - Memoirs of a Withered Rose: 
The main focus of this assignment is to develop a spatial sense of exploration for the player. Having graphics is one aspect of providing a sense of exploration, but the other criteria was to eliminate (as much as possible) the sense of linearity from the story, in that the player is allowed to interact with the story in any sequence they see fit. This project was developed on Bitsy.
